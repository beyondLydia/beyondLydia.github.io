title: Story of Lydia
---

I want to call this site Kingdom of Lydia, referring to a place of game, showing the power of play. The story behind it is explained below.

There is an interesting story about Lydians and game. They invented games as a solution against the great famine. For instance, one day they would play games (Dice) all day long to forget hanger, the other day they would enjoy food other than game. In this way, they survived for 18 years. As the famine went even worse, the king put the Lydians into two teams, one remaining living in their motherland, the other going for an advanture to seek for food and settle down. The prince Tyrsenos lead the latter, and they went down to the sea at Smyrna, sailed, passed lots of nations and finally decided to build a new city in the land of the Ombricans, where they called themselves Tyrsenians, named after their leader Tyrsenos.
