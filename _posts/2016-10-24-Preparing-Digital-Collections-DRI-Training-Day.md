DRI is short for Digital Repository of Ireland, designed for Humanities and Social Sciences Data. A wide range of digital collections are gathered together, including maps, phogographs, letters, audio-visual, sound, books, oral histories, paintings and so on.

During these day-long series of workshops on 12th October, we went through four sections:

    Organising Your Collection
    Digitising Your Collection
    Understanding Copyright
    Introduction to Metadata

With the flooding data in this information age, learning the right way to build an archive is necessary. I don’t have the background of archiving, but I really enjoy the feeling of arranging all my documents well in a reasonable way.

Here is a figure showing how does the archive work, from Kevin Long’s slide.

Then in the second workshop, a question is raised: Why do you digitize? Who is the audience of the digital content? I think the same type of question should be asked before any kind of creation. This will help us avoid wasting time. This workshop also focus on introducing different devices and technology used in digital capturing systems. I am familiar with cameras, scanners, color management or white balance, but dedicated book scanning system is totally new to me.
