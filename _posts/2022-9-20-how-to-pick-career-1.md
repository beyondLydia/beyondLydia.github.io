This is a post about something I’ve been wanting to write about forever: careers. Society tells us a lot of things about what we should want in a career and what the possibilities are—which is weird because I’m pretty sure society knows very little about any of this. When it comes to careers, society is like your great uncle who traps you at holidays and goes on a 15-minute mostly incoherent unsolicited advice monologue, and you tune out almost the whole time because it’s super clear he has very little idea what he’s talking about and that everything he says is like 45 years outdated. Society is like that great uncle, and conventional wisdom is like his rant. Except in this case, instead of tuning it out, we pay rapt attention to every word, and then we make major career decisions based on what he says. Kind of a weird thing for us to do.

这是一篇关于我一直想写的东西的帖子：职业。社会告诉我们很多关于我们应该在职业中想要什么以及可能性有哪些——这很奇怪，因为我很确定社会对这些知之甚少。谈到职业，社会就像你的叔祖父，他在假期里把你困住，独自发表时长15 分钟、大部分是语无伦次、不请自来的建议，而你无动于衷，因为很明显他几乎不知道自己在说什么，关于他所说的一切都像是过时了45年。社会就像那个叔祖父，传统智慧就像他的咆哮。然而在这种情况下，我们没有叫停这件事，而是全神贯注地关注每一个字，然后我们根据他所说的经验做出重大的职业决定。对于我们这么做是一件很奇怪的事情。

This post isn’t me giving you career advice really—it’s a framework that I think can help you make career decisions that actually reflect who you are, what you want, and what our rapidly changing career landscape looks like today. You’re not a pro at this, but you’re certainly more qualified to figure out what’s best for you than our collective un-self-aware great uncle. For those of you yet to start your career who aren’t sure what you want to do with their lives, or those of you currently in the middle of your career who aren’t sure you’re on the right path, I hope this post can help you press the reset button on your thought process and get some clarity.

这篇文章并不是我给你的职业建议——我认为它是一个框架，我认为它可以帮助你做出职业决策，真正反映你是谁，你想要什么，以及我们今天快速变化的职业环境是什么样的。你不是这方面的专家，但你肯定比我们集体无自我意识的叔祖父更有资格找出最适合你的东西。对于那些尚未开始职业生涯但不确定自己想要做什么的人，或者那些目前正处于职业生涯中期但不确定自己是否走在正确道路上的人，我希望这帖子可以帮助你按下思维过程中的重置按钮并让思路更加清晰一些。

Finally, it feels very good to put this post up. It’s been way, way too long. The last year has been pretty frustrating for me and anyone who likes Wait But Why—a lot of build-up of ideas with none of the satisfying release of those ideas on the blog (most of my last year has been spent working on another, way longer post). I’m hoping this WBW Dark Ages era is nearing its end, because I miss hanging out here. Thanks, as always, to the small group of ridiculously generous, ridiculously patient patrons who have stuck with us through such a slow period.

最后，把这个帖子发出来感觉非常好。已经过去了很久。去年对我和任何喜欢 Wait But Why这篇文章 的人来说都非常令人沮丧——我积累了很多想法，但没有篇令人满意博客发表（我去年的大部分时间都花在了另一个更长的博文上）。我希望这个 WBW 黑暗时代即将结束，因为我想念在这里闲逛。一如既往地感谢一小群非常慷慨、非常耐心的patron支持者，他们在如此缓慢的时期里一直陪伴着我们。


Your Life Path So Far

到目前为止你的人生道路

For most of us, childhood is kind of like a river, and we’re kind of like tadpoles.

对于我们大多数人来说，童年有点像一条河，我们有点像蝌蚪。

We didn’t choose the river. We just woke up out of nowhere and found ourselves on some path set for us by our parents, by society, and by circumstances. We’re told the rules of the river and the way we should swim and what our goals should be. Our job isn’t to think about our path—it’s to succeed on the path we’ve been placed on, based on the way success has been defined for us.

我们没有选择河流。 我们突然醒来，发现自己走上了父母、社会和环境为我们设定的道路。 我们被告知河流的规则、我们应该游泳的方式以及我们的目标应该是什么。 我们的工作不是思考我们的道路——而是根据为我们定义的成功方式，在我们被安排的道路上取得成功。

For many of us—and I suspect for a large portion of Wait But Why readers—our childhood river then feeds into a pond, called college.

对于我们中的许多人来说——我怀疑对于《等待但为什么》的大部分读者来说——我们童年的河流然后汇入一个叫做大学的池塘。

We may have some say in which particular pond we landed in, but in the end, most college ponds aren’t really that different from one another.

我们可能会说我们降落在哪个特定的池塘，但最后，大多数大学池塘彼此之间并没有那么不同。

In the pond, we have a bit more breathing room and some leeway to branch out into more specific interests. We start to ponder, looking out at the pond’s shores—out there where the real world starts and where we’ll be spending the rest of our lives. This usually brings some mixed feelings.

在池塘里，我们有更多的喘息空间和一些余地，可以扩展到更具体的兴趣。 我们开始思考，看着池塘的岸边——那里是现实世界的起点，也是我们将在哪里度过余生的地方。 这通常会带来一些复杂的感觉。

And then, 22 years after waking up in a rushing river, we’re kicked out of the pond and told by the world to go make something of our lives.

然后，在湍急的河流中醒来 22 年后，我们被踢出池塘，世界告诉我们要去创造我们的生活。

There are a few problems here. One is that at that moment, you’re kind of skill-less and knowledge-less and a lot of other things-less:

这里有几个问题。 一个是在那一刻，你有点缺乏技能和知识，还有很多其他的东西更少：

But before you can even address your general uselessness, there’s an even bigger issue—your pre-set path ended. Kids in school are kind of like employees of a company where someone else is the CEO. But no one is the CEO of your life in the real world, or of your career path—except you. And you’ve spent your whole life becoming a pro student, leaving you with zero experience as the CEO of anything. Up to now, you’ve only been in charge of the micro decisions—”How do I succeed at my job as a student?”—and now you’re suddenly holding the keys to the macro cockpit as well, tasked with answering stressful macro questions like “Who am I?” and “What are the important things in life?” and “What are my options for paths and which one should I choose and how do I even make a path?” When we leave school for the last time, the macro guidance we’ve become so accustomed to is suddenly whisked away from us, leaving us standing there holding our respective dicks, with no idea how to do this.

但在你解决你普遍的无用问题之前，还有一个更大的问题——你的预设路径已经结束。学校里的孩子有点像公司的员工，其他人是首席执行官。但没有人是你在现实世界中生活或职业道路的首席执行官——除了你。而且您一生都在成为一名职业学生，而您作为任何事物的 CEO 的经验为零。到目前为止，你只负责微观决策——“作为一名学生，我如何在工作中取得成功？”——现在你突然也掌握了宏观驾驶舱的钥匙，负责应对压力诸如“我是谁？”之类的宏观问题和“生活中最重要的事情是什么？”和“我的路径有哪些选择，我应该选择哪一条，我什至如何制作路径？”当我们最后一次离开学校时，我们已经习以为常的宏观指导突然从我们身边消失了，让我们站在那里拿着各自的鸡巴，不知道该怎么做

Then time happens. And we end up on a path. And that path becomes our life’s story.

然后时间流逝。我们最终走上了一条道路。这条道路成为我们人生的故事。

At the end of our life, when we look back at how things went, we can see our life’s path in its entirety, from an aerial view.

在我们生命的尽头，当我们回顾事情的经过时，我们可以从空中俯瞰整个人生轨迹。

When scientists study people on their deathbed and how they feel about their lives, they usually find that many of them feel some serious regrets. I think a lot of those regrets stem from the fact that most of us aren’t really taught about path-making in our childhoods, and most of us also don’t get much better at path-making as adults, which leaves many people looking back on a life path that didn’t really make sense, given who they are and the world they lived in.

当科学家们研究临终者以及他们对生活的感受时，他们通常会发现他们中的许多人都感到一些严重的遗憾。 我认为很多遗憾都源于我们大多数人在童年时代并没有真正接受过关于造道的教育，而且我们大多数人在成年后也没有在造道方面做得更好，这让很多人 考虑到他们是谁以及他们所生活的世界，回顾一条没有真正意义的人生道路。

So this is a post about path-making. Let’s take a 30-minute pre-deathbed pause to look down at the path we’re on, and ahead at where that path seems to be going, and make sure it makes sense.

所以这是一篇关于路径制作的帖子。 让我们在临终前暂停 30 分钟，看看我们正在走的路，然后看看这条路似乎要走的地方，并确保它是有意义的。

The Cook and the Chef—Revisited

主厨 vs 厨师——重写

In the past, I’ve written about the critical distinction between “reasoning from first principles” and “reasoning by analogy”—or what I called being a “chef” vs. being a “cook.” Since writing the post, I notice this distinction everywhere, and I’ve thought about it roughly 2 million times in my own life.

过去，我写过“从第一原理推理”和“类比推理”之间的关键区别——或者我所说的“厨师”与“厨师”之间的关键区别。 自从写这篇文章以来，我到处都注意到了这种区别，我在自己的生活中已经思考了大约 200 万次。

reasoning from first principles=从第一原理推理
reasoning by analogy=类比原理

Tim Urban在他的之前的一篇文章中分析了这两种方式的优缺点https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html）。

The idea is that reasoning from first principles is reasoning like a scientist.

从第一法则推理的想法就是像科学家一样推理。

You take core facts and observations and use them to puzzle together a conclusion, kind of like a chef playing around with raw ingredients to try to make them into something good.

你挑选核心证据和观察结果，用它们来拼合出一个结论，有点像厨师尝试食材原材料，尝试把它们做成好吃的菜肴。

By doing this puzzling, a chef eventually writes a new recipe. The other kind of reasoning—reasoning by analogy—happens when you look at the way things are already done and you essentially copy it, with maybe a little personal tweak here and there—kind of like a cook following an already written recipe.

通过解这个谜题，一个厨师最后会写出一个新菜谱。其他类型的推理，类比推理，是你观察其他事情已经被执行的方式，然后你实际上就是复制它的操作，也许或多或少加一点个人的理解，就像一个厨子按照写好的菜谱做菜。

A pure verbatim recipe-copying cook and a pure independently inventive chef are the two extreme ends of what is, of course, a spectrum. But for any particular part of your life that involves reasoning and decision making, wherever you happen to be on the spectrum, your reasoning process can usually be boiled down to fundamentally chef-like or fundamentally cook-like. Creating vs. copying. Originality vs. conformity.

当然，一个只会照本宣科复刻食谱的厨师和一个只独立发明的厨师是两个极端。 但是对于你生活中涉及推理和决策的任何特定部分，无论你碰巧在哪个频段内，你的推理过程通常可以归结为类主厨本质或类厨师本质。 创建比拼复制。 独创性比拼一致性。

Being a chef takes a tremendous amount of time and energy—which makes sense, because you’re not trying to reinvent the wheel, you’re trying to invent it for the first time.

做一个主厨需要巨大的时间与精力，这很合理，因为你不是尝试再次造轮子，而是尝试第一个发明它。

Puzzling your way to a conclusion feels like navigating a mysterious forest while blindfolded and always involves a whole lot of failure, in the form of trial and error.

揭开你自己通往结论的道路，就像蒙着眼睛导航在神秘的森林中，经历考验、偏差，包括一次又一次的失败。

Being a cook is far easier and more straightforward and less icky. In most situations, being a chef is a terrible waste of time, and comes with a high opportunity cost, since time on Earth is immensely scarce.

做一名厨师要容易得多，更直接，也不会那么讨厌。 在大多数情况下，当主厨是一种可怕的时间浪费，并且伴随着高昂的机会成本，因为地球上的时间非常稀缺。

Right now, I’m wearing J. Crew jeans and a plain t-shirt and a hoodie and Allbirds shoes, because I’m trying to conform.
现在，我穿着J. Crew牛仔裤，纯色t恤衫，一件连帽衫和Allbirds懒人鞋，因为我试着去顺应自我。

Throughout my life, I’ve looked around at people who seem kind of like me and I’ve bought a bunch of clothes that look like what they wear. And this makes sense—because clothes aren’t important to me, and they’re not how I choose to express my individuality.

纵观我的生活，我环顾四周，看看那些看起来有点像我的人，我买了一堆看起来像是他们穿的衣服。这有意义——因为衣服对我来说并不重要，它们不是我选择表达我个性的方式。

So in my case, fashion is a perfect part of life to use a reasoning shortcut and be a cook.

所以就我而言，时尚是生活中一个可以完美使用推理捷径的部分，做一名厨子。

But then there are those parts of life that are really really deeply important—like where you choose to live, or the kinds of friends you choose to make, or whether you want to get married and to whom, or whether you want to have kids and how you want to raise them, or how you set your lifestyle priorities.

但是生命中有些部分是尤为重要的，比如你选择在哪里生活，交什么样的朋友，是否想要生育孩子，如何养育孩子，或者你如何设定生活方式的优先级。

Career-path-carving is definitely one of those really really deeply important things. Let’s spell out the obvious reasons why:

Time. For most of us, a career (including ancillary career time, like time spent commuting and thinking about your work) will eat up somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000 hours.

职业道路雕刻绝对是那些非常非常重要的事情之一。 让我们详细说明原因：

时间。 对于我们大多数人来说，一份职业（包括辅助职业时间，比如通勤和思考工作的时间）会消耗 50,000 到 150,000 小时。

At the moment, a long human life runs at about 750,000 hours. When you subtract childhood (~175,000 hours) and the portion of your adult life you’ll spend sleeping, eating, exercising, and otherwise taking care of the human pet you live in, along with errands and general life upkeep (~325,000 hours), you’re left with 250,000 “meaningful adult hours.”

人生总长度75万小时，减掉童年17.5万小时，成年期间睡觉、吃饭、运动、照顾家人宠物的时间，以及一些杂事和生活事务32.5万小时。你还剩下25万有意义的成年时间

So a typical career will take up somewhere between 20% and 60% of your meaningful adult time—not something to be a cook about.

一份典型的职业将会占据你有意义的成年时光的2到6成，这可不是什么适合做厨子的工作。

Quality of Life. 

生活质量

Your career has a major effect on all the non-career hours as well. For those of us not already wealthy through past earnings, marriage, or inheritance, a career doubles as our means of support. The particulars of your career also often play a big role in determining where you live, how flexible your life is, the kinds of things you’re able to do in your free time, and sometimes even in who you end up marrying.

你的职业对所有非职业时间也有重大影响。 对于我们这些尚未因过去的收入、婚姻或遗产而变得富有的人来说，职业是我们的支持手段。 你职业生涯的细节也常常在决定你住在哪里、你的生活有多灵活、你在空闲时间能做的事情种类、有时甚至决定你最终嫁给谁方面发挥着重要作用。

Impact. 

影响

On top of your career being the way you spend much of your time and the means of support for the rest of your time, your career triples as your primary mode of impact-making. Every human life touches thousands of other lives in thousands of different ways, and all of those lives you alter then go on to touch thousands of lives of their own.

除了你的职业生涯是你花费大部分时间的方式和剩余时间的支持方式之外，你的职业生涯是你产生影响的主要方式的三倍。 每个人的生命都以数千种不同的方式触动着数以千计的其他生命，而你所改变的所有这些生命又会继续触动他们自己的数以千计的生命。

We can’t test this, but I’m pretty sure that you can select any 80-year-old alive today, go back in time 80 years, find them as an infant, throw the infant in the trash, and then come back to the present day and find a countless number of things changed. All lives make a large impact on the world and on the future—but the kind of impact you end up making is largely within your control, depending on the values you live by and the places you direct your energy. Whatever shape your career path ends up taking, the world will be altered by it.

我们无法对此进行测试，但我很确定你可以选择任何一个今天还活着的 80 岁老人，回到 80 年前，找到他们还是婴儿，把婴儿扔进垃圾桶，然后再回来 到现在，发现无数的事情发生了变化。 所有的生命都会对世界和未来产生巨大影响——但你最终产生的影响在很大程度上是在你的控制范围内，这取决于你所遵循的价值观和你引导能量的地方。 无论你的职业道路最终采取何种形式，世界都会因此而改变。

Identity. 

身份

In our childhoods, people ask us about our career plans by asking us what we want to be when we grow up. When we grow up, we tell people about our careers by telling them what we are. We don’t say, “I practice law”—we say, “I am a lawyer.” This is probably an unhealthy way to think about careers, but the way many societies are right now, a person’s career quadruples as the person’s primary identity. Which is kind of a big thing.

在我们的童年时代，人们通过问我们长大后想成为什么样的人来询问我们的职业规划。 当我们长大后，我们通过告诉他们我们是什么来告诉他们我们的职业。 我们不会说“我从事法律工作”——我们会说“我是一名律师”。 这可能是一种不健康的职业思考方式，但就像现在许多社会一样，一个人的职业是个人主要身份的四倍。 这是一件大事。

So yeah—your career path isn’t like my shitty sweatshirt. It’s really really deeply important, putting it squarely in “Definitely absolutely make sure to be a chef about it” territory.

所以，是的——你的职业道路不像我的破运动衫。 这真的非常重要，直接把它放在“绝对绝对确保成为一个厨师”的领域。

Your Career Map

你的职业地图

Which brings us to you. I don’t know exactly what your deal is. But there’s a good chance you’re somewhere in one of the blue regions—
—which means your career path is a work in progress.

这把我们带到了你身边。 我不知道你的交易是什么。 但是你很有可能在某个蓝色区域的某个地方——
——这意味着你的职业道路还在进行中。

Whether you’re yet to start your career or well into it, somewhere in the back of your mind (or maybe in the very front of it) is a “Career Plans” map.

无论你刚开始职业还是已经深入其中，内心深处的某一处，或者表层，有一张职业计划地图

We can group map holders into three broad categories—each of which is well-represented in the river, in the pond, standing on the shore, and at every stage of adult life.

我们可以将地图持有者分为三大类——每一类都在河流、池塘、岸边以及成年生活的每个阶段都有很好的表现。

One group of people will look at the map and see a big, stressful question mark.巨大，压力重重的问号。

一组人会看地图，看到一个很大的、压力很大的问号。

These are people who feel indecisive 优柔寡断about their career path. They’ve been told to follow their passion, but they don’t feel especially passionate about anything. They’ve been told to let their strengths guide them, but they’re not sure what they’re best at. They may have felt they had answers in the past, but they’ve changed and they’re no longer sure who they are or where they’re going.

这些人对自己的职业道路犹豫不决。 他们被告知要追随自己的热情，但他们对任何事情都没有特别的热情。 他们被告知要让自己的优势引导他们，但他们不确定自己最擅长什么。 他们过去可能觉得自己有答案，但他们已经改变了，他们不再确定自己是谁或要去哪里。

Other people will see a nice clear arrow representing a direction they feel confident is right—but find their legs walking in a different direction. They’re living with one of the most common sources of human 苦难misery, a career path they know in their heart is wrong.

其他人会看到一个漂亮的清晰箭头，代表他们认为正确的方向 - 但发现他们的腿走在不同的方向。 他们生活在最常见的人类保护痛苦来源之一中，他们心里知道这条职业道路是错误的。

The lucky ones feel they know where they want to go and believe they’re marching in that direction.行进

幸运的一波人感到他们知道他们想去哪，相信他们正朝着这个方向行进

But even these people should pause and ask themselves, “Who actually drew this arrow? Was it really me?” The answer can get confusing.

但是即便时这些人也应该暂停问问自己，“谁画的这个箭头？是我自己么？“这个答案可能令人困惑

I’m pretty sure all of these people would benefit from a moment of career path reflection.

我很确定所有这些人都能从片刻的职业道路反思中获益。

The Okay But Why Do You Think You Can Help Me With My Career Reflection You Draw Stick Figures for a Living Blue Box

“看着还行但为什么你认为你可以帮助我职业反思，你给一个活着的蓝色盒子画木棍数字“

Extremely fair question. One thing I always ask myself as I pick topics to write about is, “Am I qualified to write about this?” Here are the reasons I decided to take on this topic:

很合理的问题。当我选择写作话题的时候，我总是扪心自问：“我有资格写这个吗？“。以下是我决定采用这个话题的原因：

I have spent most of the last 20 years in a perpetual state of analyzing my own career path.

My path has taken a lot of turns—from wanting to be a movie star when I was 7 to wanting to be the president when I was 17 to wanting to write film scores when I was 22 to wanting to be an entrepreneur when I was 24 to wanting to write musicals when I was 29 to most recently wanting to be a writer-ish guy.

After being pretty all over the place about my career path for most of my life, I actually love my job now. That’s always subject to change, but being able to look at the decision-making processes that led me to confusing or frustrating places, side by side with the decisions that led me to a more fulfilling place, has offered me some wisdom on where people tend to go wrong.

On top of having my own story to look at, I’ve had a front-row seat for the stories of my dozen or so closest friends. My friends seem to share my career path obsessiveness, so between observing their paths and talking with them about those paths again and again along the way, I’ve broadened my views on the topic, which helps me to distinguish between the lessons that are my-life specific and those that are more universal.

Finally, this isn’t a post about which careers are better or worse than others or which career values are more or less meaningful—there are lots of social scientists and self-help authors out there with good data on that, and I’m not one of them. It’s instead a framework that I think can help a career-path reflector better see their own situation, and what really matters to them, clearly and honestly. This framework has worked really well for me, so I think it can probably be helpful for other people too.

1 我花费了过去二十年的大部分时间分析自己的职业道路

2 我的人生经历了很多转折，从7岁时想成为电影明星，17岁时想当总统，22岁时想写电影配乐，24岁时想做企业家，29岁时想创作音乐剧，最近想成为一名作家。

3 在职业道路上兜兜转转了大半生以后，我现在真的很热爱我的工作。情况总是会发生变化，但能够看到导致我陷入困惑或令人沮丧的地方的决策过程，和看到一些让我进入一个更令人满意的地方的决策，让我对人们容易出错的地方有了一些人生智慧。

4 除了有我自己的故事要看之外，我还亲身听了十几个最亲密的朋友讲故事。我的朋友似乎分享了与我相同的职业道路执念，一路上我始终在观察他们的道路和与他们聊道路发展，在这个话题上的见识逐渐广博，这帮助了我分辨某些经验教训是我特有的还是普世的。

5 最后一点，这不是一篇讲述某些职业更好或者更差，或者哪些职业价值观更有或者更没意义的文章。有很多社科学家和自助书籍作家在这方面有很好的数据，我不是其中之一。相反，我提供一个框架，可以帮助职业道路反思者更好地了解自己的情况，以及对他们来说真正重要的是什么。这个框架对我来说非常有效，所以我认为它可能对其他人也有帮助。

Now that you’ve taken a fresh look at your Career Plans map, along with whatever arrow may or may not be on it, put it down and out of sight. We’ll come back to it at the end of the post. It’s time now for a deep dive—let’s think about this from scratch. From first principles.

现在你已经重新审视了自己的职业规划图，其中有可能有，也有可能没有箭头方向。把它放到一边，看不到的地方。我们在文章的最后将会回到这里。现在是时候深入探索，让我们从头思考。从第一法则开始。

In the cook-chef post, I designed a simple framework for how a chef makes major career choices. At its core is a simple Venn diagram.
The first part of the diagram is the Want Box, which contains all the careers you find desirable.
The second part of the diagram is the Reality Box. The Reality Box is for the set of all careers that are realistic to potentially achieve—based on a comparison, in each case, between your level of potential in an area and the general difficulty of achieving success in that area.

在厨子-主厨的文章中，我设计了一个简单的框架描述一个主厨如何进行重要的职业选择。其中核心是一个简单的韦恩图。
图标的第一部分是欲望格子，包括你向往的所有职业。
第二个部分是现实格子。现实格子包括所有你有可能达成的职业，前提是比较过你在该领域的潜力与该领域普遍获取成功的难度等级。

The overlapping area contains your optimal career path choices—the set of arrows you should consider drawing on your Career Map. We can call it the Option Pool.

交集区域包含着你可能的职业道路选择，这组箭头你应该考虑画到你的职业规划上。我们可以称之为选项池。

This is straightforward enough. But actually filling in these boxes accurately is way harder than it looks. For the diagram to work, it has to be as close to the truth as possible, and to get there, we have to lift up the hood of our subconscious and head down. Let’s start with the Want Box.

这足够直接了。但是真实准确地填满这些格子比看起来难很多。表格制作地时候，一定要尽可能贴近实际，为了达到这点，我们必须掀起潜意识的兜帽，低下头。就从欲望格子开始吧。

Deep Analysis, Part 1: Your Want Bo

深度分析，第1部分：你的欲望盒子

The hard thing about the Want Box is that you want a bunch of different things—or, rather, there are a bunch of different sides of you, and each of them wants—and fears—its own stuff. And since some motivations have conflicting interests with others, you cannot, by definition, have everything you want. Going for one thing you want means, by definition, not going for others, and sometimes, it’ll specifically mean going directly against others. The Want Box is a game of compromise.

欲望盒子的困难之处在于，你想要一堆不同的东西，或者更确切地说，你有很多不同的方面，每个人都欲望和恐惧。由于某些动机与其他动机存在利益冲突，很明显，你不可能拥有你想要的一切。追求了你的一个欲望，明显意味着放弃其他，有时，这意味着对抗了其他选择。欲望盒子是一个妥协的游戏。

The Yearning Octopus

渴望的章鱼

To do a proper Want Box audit, you need to think about what you yearn for in a career and then unpack the shit out of it. Luckily, we have someone here who can help us. The Yearning Octopus.

要做一个妥当的需求调查，你需要考虑以下一下你在职业生涯中渴望什么，然后把它从中剥离出来。幸运的是，我们这里有人可以帮助我们。渴望的章鱼。

We each have our own personal Yearning Octopus in our heads. The particulars of each person’s Yearning Octopus will vary, but people also aren’t all that different from each other, and I bet many of us feel very similar yearnings and fears (especially given that I find that Wait But Why readers tend to have a lot in common).

我们每个人都有自己的个人渴望章鱼在我们的头脑中。每个人渴望的章鱼的细节会有所不同，但人与人之间也没有太大的不同，我敢打赌，我们中的许多人都感到非常相似的渴望和恐惧（特别是考虑到“Wait But Why”的读者们往往有很多共同点）。

The first thing to think about is that there are totally distinct yearning worlds—each living on one tentacle. These tentacles often do not get along with each other.

首先要考虑的是，这里有完全不同的渴望世界，每个都生活在一个触角上。这些触角通常不能融洽相处。

It gets worse. Each tentacle is made up of a bunch of different individual yearnings and their accompanying fears—and these often massively conflict with each other too.

Let’s take a closer look at each tentacle to see what’s going on.

情况变得更糟。每个触角都是由一系列不同的个人渴望和伴随而来的恐惧组成的，这些渴望和恐惧也常常相互冲突。
让我们仔细看看每个触角，看看发生了什么。

The Personal Yearnings tentacle is probably the hardest one to generalize here—it’s pretty particular to each of us. It’s a reflection of our specific personality and our values, and it bears the burden of probably the most complex and challenging human need: fulfillment. It’s also in the shit dealing with not only our current selves, but a bunch of our past selves too. The dreams of 7-year-old you and the idealized identity of 12-year-old you and the secret hopes of 17-year-old you and the evolving passions of your current self are all somewhere on the personal tentacle, each throwing their own little fit about getting what they want, and each fully ready to make you feel horrible about yourself with their disappointment and disgust if you fail them. On top of that, your fear of death sometimes emerges on the personal tentacle, all needy about you leaving your mark and achieving greatness and all that. The personal tentacle is why you don’t find very many billionaires content to spend the rest of their life sipping cocktails on the beach—it’s a highly needy tentacle.

个人渴望触手可能是这里最难概括的触手——它对我们每个人都非常特殊。它反映了我们特定的个性和价值观，它承载着可能是人类最复杂和最具挑战性的需求：满足感。它不仅与我们现在的自己有关，而且还与旧时光的自己打交道。 7岁时你的梦想，12岁时你的理想身份，17岁时你隐秘的希望，现在的你不断发展的激情，都在个人触手的某处，每个触角都在拼命争取自己想要的东西，如果你让他们失望，每个触角都准备好，让你因为他们的失望和厌恶而对自己感到恐惧。

最重要的是，你对死亡的恐惧有时会出现在个人触手上，祈求你留下印记，实现伟大的成就，诸如此类。 个人触手是为什么你难以找到很多满足于余生在海滩上喝鸡尾酒的亿万富翁——这是一条非常高需求度的触手。

And yet, the personal tentacle is also one that often ends up somewhat neglected. Because in many cases, it’s the ickiest set of yearnings to really go for; because the fears of this tentacle aren’t scary in an immediate way—they creep in out of the background over time; and because the personal tentacle is always at risk of getting bowled over early in your career by the powerful animal emotions of the other tentacles. This neglect can leave a person with major regrets later on once the dust settles. An unfulfilled Personal Yearnings tentacle is often the explanation, for example, behind a very successful, very unhappy person—who may believe they got successful in the wrong field.

然而，个人触手也是一个经常被忽视的触手。 因为在很多情况下，这是最令人讨厌的渴望组合。 因为对这种触手的恐惧并不是即时的恐惧——它们会随着时间的推移从幕布后爬出来； 因为在你职业生涯的早期，个人触手总是有被其他触手强大的动物情感打败的风险。 一旦尘埃落定，这种疏忽可能会让一个人日后感到非常遗憾。 一个未实现的个人渴望触手通常是背后的答案，例如，在一个非常成功、非常不快乐的人背后——他们可能认为自己在错误的领域取得了成功。

The Social Yearnings tentacle is probably our most primitive, animal side, with its core drive stemming back to our tribal evolutionary past. On the tentacle are a number of odd creatures.

社会欲望触手可能是我们最原始的动物一面，其核心驱动力可以追溯到我们部落进化的过去。这只触手上有许多奇怪的生物。

As we’ve discussed before on this blog, we all have a Social Survival Mammoth living in our heads who’s earth-shatteringly obsessed with what other people think of us. This means he craves acceptance and inclusion and being well-liked, while likewise being petrified of embarrassment, negative judgment, and disapproval. He really really really wants to be in the in-group and he really really really doesn’t want to be in the outgroup. He’s quite cute though.

正如我们之前在这个博客上讨论过的，我们的脑海中都生活着一个社会生存长毛象，面对他人对我们的看法，它有着惊天动地的痴迷。 这意味着它渴望接受、包容和受欢迎，同时也对尴尬、负面判断和不赞成感到恐惧。 它真的真的很想成为社群的一份子，也真的真的真的不想被排除在社群外。 虽然它确实很可爱。

Then there’s your ego, who’s a similar character but even more needy. Your ego doesn’t just want to be accepted; it wants to be admired, desired, and fawned upon—ideally, on a mass scale. More upsetting to it than being disliked is being ignored. It wants to be relevant and important and widely known.

然后是你的自我，它是一个相似的角色，但需求度更高。 你的自我不只是想被接受； 它想要被钦佩、渴望和讨好——最好是广泛认可。 比起不被喜欢更令人不安的是被忽视。 它希望自己参与其中、重要和广为人知。

There are other characters milling about as well. Somewhere else on the social tentacle is a little judge with a little gavel who gets very butthurt if it thinks people aren’t judging you fairly—if you’re not appropriately appreciated. It’s very important to the judge that people are aware of exactly how smart and talented you think you are. The judge is also big on holding grudges—which is the reason a lot of people are driven more than anything by a desire to show that person or those people who never believed in them.

还有其他角色也在左右徘徊。 社交触手上有一个拿着小木槌的小法官，如果它认为人们没有公平地评判你——如果你没有得到适当的赏识，就会被惹毛。 对法官来说，人们清楚地知道你聪明、有天分，正如自我认知中的样子，这一点非常重要。 法官也很会怀恨在心——这就是为什么很多人更有动力展示给不相信他们的那个（些）人。

Finally, some of us may find a loving little dog on our social tentacle who wants more than anything in the world to please its owner, and who just cannot bear the thought of disappointing them. The one problem with this adorable creature is that its owner isn’t you. It’s a person with so much psychological power over you that, if you’re not careful, you may dedicate your whole career to trying to please them and make them proud. (It’s probably a parent.)

最后，我们中的一些人可能会在我们的社交触角上找到一只充满爱意的小狗，它最想取悦它的主人，并且无法忍受让他们失望的想法。 这个可爱的生物的一个问题是，它的主人不是你。 这个主人是一个对你有很大的心理影响的人，如果一不小心，可能你会奉献整个职业生涯，试图取悦他们并让他们感到自豪。 （可能是父母。）

The Lifestyle Yearnings tentacle mostly just wants Tuesday to be a good day. But like, a really pleasant, enjoyable day—with plenty of free time and self-care and relaxation and luxuries.

生活方式欲望触手大多只是希望星期二是美好的一天。 但需要是一个非常愉快、愉快的一天——有大量的空闲时间、自我照看、放松和奢侈。

It’s also concerned with your life in the big picture being as great as possible—as far as your lifestyle tentacle is concerned, you should be able to do what you want to do in life, when and how you want to do it, with the people you like most. Life should be full of fun times and rich experiences, but it should also roll by smoothly, without too much hard work and as few bumps in the road as possible.

它还关心你在旷阔前景中的生活是否尽可能美好——就你的生活方式触手而言，你应该能够在生活中与你最喜欢的人一起，做你想做的事情，无论何时以及如何去做。 生活应该充满乐趣和丰富的经历，但也应该一帆风顺，没有太多的努力，道路上的颠簸越少越好。

The issue is, even if you place a high priority on your lifestyle yearnings, it’s pretty difficult to keep the whole tentacle happy at the same time. The part of the tentacle that just wants to sit around and relax will hold you back from sweating to build the kind of career that offers long-term flexibility and the kind of wealth that can make life luxurious and cushy and full of toys. The part of the tentacle that only feels comfortable when the future feels predictable will reject the exact kinds of paths that may generate the long-term freedom another part of the tentacle longs for. The side of you that wants a stress-free life doesn’t get along very well with the side of you that thirsts to be hang gliding off a cliff in Namibia like Richard Branson.

问题是，即使你把对生活方式的渴望放在首位，也很难同时让整个触手都开心。 只是想坐下来放松的触手部分会阻止你流汗奋斗，以建立一种提供长期灵活性的职业和提供足够资产让生活奢华、轻松和充满玩物。 只有当未来看上去可以预测时，触手的这部分才会感到舒适，而这部分会断送另一种路径，一种触手的另一部分渴望的、可能产生长期自由的确切路径。 想要过上无压力生活的你，与渴望像理查德布兰森一样从纳米比亚悬崖滑下的你，相处得并不融洽。

The Moral Yearnings tentacle thinks the rest of the tentacles of your Yearning Octopus are a real pack of dicks—each one more self-involved and self-indulgent than the next. The parts of you on the moral tentacle look around and see a big world that needs so much fixing; they see billions of people no less worthy than you of a good life who just happened to be born into inferior circumstances; they see an uncertain future ahead that hangs in the balance between utopia and dystopia for life on Earth—a future we can actually push in the right direction if we could only get our other tentacles out of our way. While the other tentacles fantasize about what you would do with your life if you had a billion dollars in the bank, the moral tentacle fantasizes about the kind of impact you could make if you had a billion dollars to deploy.

道德渴望触手认为你的渴望章鱼的其余触手是一群真正的鸡巴——每一个都比下一个更自说自话和自我放纵。 在道德触手上的部分自我环顾四周，看到一个需要大量修复的广阔世界； 他们看到数十亿人与你一样值得过上好日子，而这些人恰好出生在较差的环境中； 他们看到了一个不确定的未来，这份未来在地球生命的乌托邦和反乌托邦之间保持平衡——只要我们能摆脱其他触手，实际上可以朝着正确的方向前进。 当其他触手幻想着如果你有 10 亿美元在银行里，你会如何生活，而道德触手则幻想着如果你有 10 亿美元可以部署，你会产生什么样的影响。

Needless to say, the other tentacles of your Yearning Octopus find the moral tentacle to be insufferable. They also can’t begin to understand philanthropy for philanthropy’s sake—they think, “Other people aren’t me, so why would I spend my time and energy working to help them?”—but they can understand philanthropy for their own motive’s sake. While the moral and lifestyle tentacles tend to be in direct conflict, others may sometimes find common ground—the social tentacle can get very into philanthropy if it’ll happen to win you respect and admiration from a highly regarded social group, and some people’s personal tentacle may find the meaning or self-worth it so craves in a philanthropic endeavor.

毫无疑问，你的渴望章鱼的其他触手觉得道德触手难以忍受。 他们也不能站在慈善角度开始理解慈善——他们认为，“别人不是我，我为什么要花时间和精力去帮助他们？”——但他们可以为了自己的动机而理解慈善 。 虽然道德和生活方式的触角往往直接冲突，但其他触角有时可能会找到共同点——社会触角可能会非常投入慈善事业，如果它碰巧赢得了一个受人尊敬的社会群体的尊重和钦佩，一些人的个人 触手可能会在慈善事业中找到它渴望已久的意义或自我价值。

That’s why, when you do something philanthropic—or anything altruistic, really—there are a few separate things going on in your head. The part of you determined to get proper public credit for the deed lives on your social tentacle; the part of you that thinks “God I’m a good person” lives on your personal tentacle; and the part of you that really loves seeing the person or group you helped be better off lives on your moral tentacle. Likewise, not doing anything for others can hurt you on multiple tentacles—the moral tentacle because it feels guilty and sad, the social tentacle because this may cause others to judge you as a selfish or greedy person, and the personal tentacle because it may lower your self-esteem.

这就是为什么当你做一些慈善的事情——或者任何无私的事情，真的——你的脑子里会发生一些不同的事情。 一部分自我生活在社交触角，决心为品行良好的自己获得适当的公共信誉； 认为“上帝，我是个好人”的那部分自我生活在你的个人触手上； 自我中真正喜欢看到你帮助过的人或团体过得更好的那部分生活在道德触角上。 同样，不为他人做任何事情会伤及多个触角——道德触角受伤是因为它感到内疚和悲伤，社交触角受伤是因为这可能会导致别人认为你是一个自私或贪婪的人，而个人触角受伤是因为这件事可能会降低你的自尊。

Your Practical Yearnings tentacle thinks all of this is fine and great—but it would also like to point out that it’s March 31st and your rent is due tomorrow, and the funny thing about that is that it logged into your bank account and saw that the number of dollars in it is actually less than the number of dollars that your landlord will need from you sometime in the next 34 hours. And yeah it knows that you deposited that check on Thursday and that it’s supposed to clear tomorrow morning, but your practical tentacle also could have sworn that just last month, all the tentacles promised that they’d make some sacrifices in order to build up at least a little bank account cushion so that simply paying the rent wouldn’t have to be really fucking stressful every month. 

你的实际欲望触手认为这一切都很好——但它还想指出，现在是 3 月 31 日，你的房租明天到期，有趣的是它登录到你的银行账户并看到其中的美元数量实际上少于您的房东在接下来的 34 小时内需要您提供的美元数量。是的，它知道你在星期四存入了那张支票，明天早上应该会结清，但你实际触手也可能发誓说就在上个月，所有的触手都承诺他们会做出一些牺牲，以便在至少有一点银行账户的缓冲，这样就不用每个月紧巴巴地付房租了。

Your practical tentacle also can’t help but notice that your social tentacle offered to buy a round of drinks for all nine people you went to the bar with last Saturday so those people would think of you as a classy, generous person, and that your lifestyle tentacle chose to rent what sure seems like a pretty nice-ass apartment for someone now living check to check, and that the updates have gotten real quiet from your friend about that bagel delivery service he started six months ago that your moral tentacle happily invested $2,500 in to help it get off the ground, and oh also that meanwhile your personal tentacle has everyone sweating their dick off working at two comedy-writing internships simultaneously that somehow manage to bring in less money combined than you made dressing up as an Egyptian enchantress to wait tables at Jekyll & Hyde sophomore year of college.

你的实际触手也忍不住注意到，你的社交触手愿意为你上周六一起去酒吧的九个人买一轮饮料，这样那些人就会认为你是一个优雅、大方的人，而你的生活方式触手选择租一套看起来相当不错的公寓，对于现在跟室友脸贴着脸的生活状态来说（shared living room？），并且您的朋友对他六个月前开始的百吉饼外卖工作这件事保持低调，您的道德触手很乐意投资2,500 美元来帮助这份事业起步，哦，同时你的个人触手让你同时在两个喜剧写作实习中大汗淋漓地工作，不知何故设法带来的钱甚至还不如你在大学二年级做Jekyll & Hyde 服务生时打扮成埃及女巫的报酬高。

At its basic level, your practical tentacle wants to make sure you can eat food and wear clothes and buy the medicine you need and not live outside. It doesn’t really care how these things happen—it just wants them to happen. But then everyone else on the octopus makes your practical tentacle’s life super hard by being fucky about things. Every time your income goes up, your lifestyle tentacle decides to raise the bar on what it wants and expects, leaving your practical tentacle continually in the shit trying to cover it all so you don’t have to run up your credit card debt. Your personal tentacle has all of these weird needs that take up a lot of time and more often than not aren’t exactly big money-makers. 

在最基本的层面上，你的实际触手想要确保你能吃饱穿衣服，买得起需要的药，避免宿街头。它并不真正关心这些事情是如何发生的——它只是希望它们发生。但是，章鱼上的其他触角都对事情操之过急，让你的触手生活变得非常艰难。每当你的收入增加时，你的生活方式触手就会决定提高它的欲求和期望的标准，让你的实际触手不断地试图覆盖这一切，而不不必增加信用卡债务。你的个人触手有所有这些奇怪的需求，这些需求会占用大量时间，而且往往赚不到什么大钱。

And while your practical tentacle would be totally down to just ask your rich uncle for money to help out, your social tentacle outlawed asking others for money because “it’s not a good look,” with your personal tentacle chiming in that “yeah, we’re better than that.”

虽然你的实际触手也可以沦落到向你有钱的叔叔要钱来帮忙，但你的社交触手禁止向别人要钱，因为“这太丢人了”，而你的个人触手则在说插嘴说“是的，我们可比那样强。”

So that’s the situation. You’ve got this Yearning Octopus in your head with five tentacles (or however many yours has), each with their own agenda, that often conflict with each other. Then there are the distinct individual yearnings on each tentacle, often in conflict amongst themselves. And if that weren’t enough, you sometimes have furious internal conflict inside a single yearning. Like when your desire to pursue your passion can’t figure out what it’s most passionate about.

所以情况就是这样。 你的脑海中有五只触手（或者不管你有多少触手），每个都有自己的议程，这些触手经常相互冲突。 然后在每条触手上都有不同的个人渴望，它们之间经常发生冲突。 这还没结束呢，你有时会在一个单一的渴望中产生激烈的内部冲突。 就像当你追求个人热情时，无法弄清楚它最热衷于什么时一样。

Or when you want so badly to be respected, but then you remember that a career that wins the undying respect of one segment of society will always receive shrugs from other segments and even contemptuous eye rolls from other segments still.

或者，当你极其渴望受到尊重时，但你又记起一种职业如果赢得社会某一部分永恒尊重，总是会得到其他部分的耸耸肩，甚至仍然会受到其他部分的蔑视。

Or when you decide to satisfy your urge to help others, 或者当你决定满足你帮助他人的冲动时，

before realizing that the part of you that wants to dedicate your life to helping to mitigate humanity’s greatest existential risks 

在有意识到之前，想要献身于帮助减轻人类最大的生存风险的那一部分自我

has palpable disdain for the part of you that would rather make a tangible positive impact on your local community

对另一个宁愿对当地社区产生切实的积极影响的自我有着明显的蔑视。 

—while the part of you that can’t stand the thought of the millions of today’s humans without access to clean water finds both of those other yearnings to be pretty cold and heartless.

而一部分自我无法忍受今天数以百万计的人类无法获得清洁水，认为其他两种渴望都非常冷酷无情。

So yeah, your Yearning Octopus is complicated. And no human in history has ever satisfied their entire octopus—that’s why you’ll never find it fully smiling. Human yearning is a game of choices and sacrifices and compromise.

所以，是的，你的欲望章鱼很复杂。 历史上没有人能满足他们的整条章鱼——这就是为什么你永远不会发现它完全微笑的原因。 人类的欲望是一场选择、牺牲和妥协的游戏。

Dissecting the Octopus

解剖章鱼

With that in mind, let’s return to your Want Box. When we think about our career goals and fears and hopes and dreams, our consciousness is just accessing the net output of the Yearning Octopus—which is usually made up of its loudest voices. Only by digging into our mind’s subconscious can we see what’s really going on.

考虑到这一点，让我们回到你的愿望箱。 当我们想到我们的职业目标、恐惧、希望和梦想时，我们的意识只是在访问渴望章鱼的净输出——它通常是由它最响亮的声音组成的。 只有深入到我们大脑的潜意识中，我们才能看到真正发生了什么。

The cool thing is that we all have the ability to do that. The stuff in your subconscious is like stuff in the basement of a house. It’s not off-limits to us—it’s just in the basement. We can go look at it anytime—we just have to A) remember that the house has a basement, and B) actually spend the time and energy to go down there, even though going down there might suck.

很酷的是，我们都有能力做到这一点。你潜意识里的东西就像房子地下室里的东西。它不是我们的禁区——它就在地下室。我们可以随时去看看——我们只需要 

A）记住房子有地下室，并且 

B）实际上花时间和精力去那里，即使去那里可能很糟糕。

So let’s head to the basement of your mind to look for the octopus. Unless you’re one of those people who’s really practiced at analyzing your subconscious, it might be dark in the basement, making it hard to see your octopus. The way to start turning the lights on is by identifying what your conscious mind currently knows about your yearnings and fears, and then unpacking it.

因此，让我们前往你心灵的地下室寻找章鱼吧。除非你是那些真正擅长分析你的潜意识的人之一，否则地下室可能很黑，很难看到你的章鱼。开始打开灯的方法是确定你的有意识的头脑目前对你的渴望和恐惧了解哪些，然后打开它。

Like if there’s a certain career path that sounds fantastic to you, unpack that. Which tentacles in particular are yearning for that career—and which specific parts of those tentacles?

假设这有一条对你来说听起来很棒的职业道路，给它开箱。哪些触手特别渴望该职业——以及确认是这些触手的哪些特定部分？

If you’re not currently working towards that career you supposedly yearn for, try to figure out why not. If you think it’s because you’re afraid of failing, unpack that. Fear of failure can emerge from any of the tentacles, so that’s not a specific enough analysis. You want to find the specific source of the fear. 

如果你目前没有为你应该渴望的职业而努力，试着找出原因。如果你认为这是因为你害怕失败，那就解开它。对失败的恐惧可能来自任何触角，因此这不是一个足够具体的分析。你想找到恐惧的具体来源。

Is it a social tentacle fear of embarrassment, or of being judged by others as not that smart, or of appearing to be not that successful to your romantic interests? Is it a personal tentacle fear of damaging your own self-image—of confirming a suspicion about yourself that haunts you? Is it a lifestyle tentacle fear of having to downgrade your living situation, or of bringing stress and instability into a currently predictable life? Or maybe that fear of a living situation downgrade isn’t actually emerging from your lifestyle tentacle, but more so from your social tentacle—in other words, is it possible you’re indifferent about the apartment change itself but super concerned about the message a lifestyle downgrade sends to your friends and family? Or are there financial commitments you simply cannot back out of at the moment, and your practical tentacle is in a genuine panic about how you’ll make ends meet should this career switch take longer than expected to work out, or not work out at all? Or are a few of these combining together to generate your fear of making the leap?

是社交触手害怕尴尬，还是害怕被别人评价为不那么聪明，或者看起来对你的浪漫兴趣不那么成功？是个人触手害怕损害自己的自我形象——确认对自己的怀疑困扰着你吗？是不是生活方式的触角害怕被迫降低你的生活状况，还是害怕给目前可预测的生活带来压力和不稳定？或者，对生活环境降级的恐惧实际上并不是来自你的生活方式触角，而是来自你的社交触角——换句话说，你是否可能对公寓改变本身漠不关心，但非常关心信息生活方式降级的信号被传递给了朋友和家人？或者是否有你目前根本无法退场的财务承诺，你的现实触手真切地恐惧你会如何收场，万一这个职业转换需要比预期更长的时间来解决，或者根本无法解决，该怎么办?还是其中一些恐惧结合在一起使您害怕尝试飞跃？

Perhaps you don’t really think it’s fear of failure that’s stopping you, but something else. Maybe it’s a dread of the change in identity—both internally and externally—that inevitably accompanies a career move like this. Maybe it’s the heavy weight of inertia—an intense resistance to change—that seems to exist in and of itself and overpowers all of your other yearnings. In either case, you’d want to unpack the feeling and ask yourself exactly which tentacles are so opposed to an identity shift, or so driven by inertia.

也许你不认为真正阻止你的是对失败的恐惧，而是别的什么。也许是对身份变化的恐惧——无论是内部还是外部——不可避免地伴随着这样的职业转变。也许是惯性的沉重负担——对改变的强烈抵制——似乎本身就存在，并压倒了你所有其他的渴望。在任何一种情况下，你都想拆解这种感觉，问问自己究竟是哪些触手如此反对身份转变，或者是由惯性驱动的。

Maybe you pine to be rich. You fantasize about a life where you make $1.2 million a year, and you feel a tremendous drive to make it happen. All five tentacles can feel a desire for wealth under certain circumstances, each for their own reasons. Unpack it.

也许你渴望富有。你幻想着一种年收入 120 万美元的生活，你会感到有一种巨大的动力去实现它。在某些情况下，所有五个触手都能感受到对财富的渴望，每一个都有自己的原因。解开这一切。

As you unpack an inner drive to make money, maybe you discover that at its core, the drive is more for a sense of security than for vast wealth. That can be unpacked too. A yearning for security at its simplest is just your practical tentacle doing what your practical tentacle does. But maybe it’s not actually basic security you want as much as a guarantee of a certain level of fanciness demanded by your lifestyle or social tentacle. 

当你打开内心的赚钱动力时，也许你会发现，从本质上讲，这种动力更多的是一种安全感，而不是巨大的财富。这点也可以拆解。最简单的对安全的渴望就是你的实际触手专注做实际触手负责的部分。但也许实际上你想要的并不是基础安全感，而是你的生活方式或社交触角所要求的特定幻想的保证。

Or perhaps what you really want is a level of security so over-the-top secure it can no longer be called a security yearning—instead, it may be an impulse by the emotional well-being section of your lifestyle tentacle to alleviate a compulsive financial stress you were raised to forever feel, almost regardless of your actual financial situation.


或者，也许你真正想要的是一种更高的安全级别，超出通常意义上的安全感，它不再被称为安全渴望——相反，它可能是你的生活方式触手里情绪健康部分的一种冲动，你从小就被养育成了一个永远强迫性感受到财务压力的状态，无论你的实际财务状况如何。

The answers to all of these questions lie somewhere on the tentacles of your Yearning Octopus. And by asking questions like these and digging deep enough to identify the true roots of your various yearnings, you start to turn on the basement light and acquaint yourself with your octopus in all its complexity.

所有这些问题的答案都在你的渴望章鱼的触手上。通过提出上面这些问题并深入挖掘以确定你各种渴望的真正根源，你开始打开地下室的灯并熟悉你的章鱼身上的全部复杂性。

You’ll also come to understand which of your inner yearnings seem to speak the loudest in your mind and carry the most pull in your decision-making processes. Pretty quickly, a yearning hierarchy will begin to reveal itself. You’ll identify yearnings that speak loudly and get their way; yearnings that cry at the top of their lungs but get continually elbowed out of the way by higher-prioritized parts of the octopus; yearnings that seem resigned to their low-status positions in the hierarchy.

你还将了解内心的哪些渴望似乎在你的脑海中表达得最响亮，并在决策过程中发挥最大的作用。很快，一种向往的阶层顺序将会展现出来。你会发现那些大声说话并如愿以偿的渴望；渴望在他们的肺顶部哭泣，但不断被章鱼中优先级更高的部分推开；似乎已经服从了自己在等级制度中地位低下的状态。
