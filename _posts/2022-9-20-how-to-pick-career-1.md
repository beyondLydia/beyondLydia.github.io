This is a post about something I’ve been wanting to write about forever: careers. Society tells us a lot of things about what we should want in a career and what the possibilities are—which is weird because I’m pretty sure society knows very little about any of this. When it comes to careers, society is like your great uncle who traps you at holidays and goes on a 15-minute mostly incoherent unsolicited advice monologue, and you tune out almost the whole time because it’s super clear he has very little idea what he’s talking about and that everything he says is like 45 years outdated. Society is like that great uncle, and conventional wisdom is like his rant. Except in this case, instead of tuning it out, we pay rapt attention to every word, and then we make major career decisions based on what he says. Kind of a weird thing for us to do.

这是一篇关于我一直想写的东西的帖子：职业。社会告诉我们很多关于我们应该在职业中想要什么以及可能性有哪些——这很奇怪，因为我很确定社会对这些知之甚少。谈到职业，社会就像你的叔祖父，他在假期里把你困住，独自发表时长15 分钟、大部分是语无伦次、不请自来的建议，而你无动于衷，因为很明显他几乎不知道自己在说什么，关于他所说的一切都像是过时了45年。社会就像那个叔祖父，传统智慧就像他的咆哮。然而在这种情况下，我们没有叫停这件事，而是全神贯注地关注每一个字，然后我们根据他所说的经验做出重大的职业决定。对于我们这么做是一件很奇怪的事情。
