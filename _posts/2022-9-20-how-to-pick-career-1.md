This is a post about something I’ve been wanting to write about forever: careers. Society tells us a lot of things about what we should want in a career and what the possibilities are—which is weird because I’m pretty sure society knows very little about any of this. When it comes to careers, society is like your great uncle who traps you at holidays and goes on a 15-minute mostly incoherent unsolicited advice monologue, and you tune out almost the whole time because it’s super clear he has very little idea what he’s talking about and that everything he says is like 45 years outdated. Society is like that great uncle, and conventional wisdom is like his rant. Except in this case, instead of tuning it out, we pay rapt attention to every word, and then we make major career decisions based on what he says. Kind of a weird thing for us to do.

这是一篇关于我一直想写的东西的帖子：职业。社会告诉我们很多关于我们应该在职业中想要什么以及可能性有哪些——这很奇怪，因为我很确定社会对这些知之甚少。谈到职业，社会就像你的叔祖父，他在假期里把你困住，独自发表时长15 分钟、大部分是语无伦次、不请自来的建议，而你无动于衷，因为很明显他几乎不知道自己在说什么，关于他所说的一切都像是过时了45年。社会就像那个叔祖父，传统智慧就像他的咆哮。然而在这种情况下，我们没有叫停这件事，而是全神贯注地关注每一个字，然后我们根据他所说的经验做出重大的职业决定。对于我们这么做是一件很奇怪的事情。

This post isn’t me giving you career advice really—it’s a framework that I think can help you make career decisions that actually reflect who you are, what you want, and what our rapidly changing career landscape looks like today. You’re not a pro at this, but you’re certainly more qualified to figure out what’s best for you than our collective un-self-aware great uncle. For those of you yet to start your career who aren’t sure what you want to do with their lives, or those of you currently in the middle of your career who aren’t sure you’re on the right path, I hope this post can help you press the reset button on your thought process and get some clarity.

这篇文章并不是我给你的职业建议——我认为它是一个框架，我认为它可以帮助你做出职业决策，真正反映你是谁，你想要什么，以及我们今天快速变化的职业环境是什么样的。你不是这方面的专家，但你肯定比我们集体无自我意识的叔祖父更有资格找出最适合你的东西。对于那些尚未开始职业生涯但不确定自己想要做什么的人，或者那些目前正处于职业生涯中期但不确定自己是否走在正确道路上的人，我希望这帖子可以帮助你按下思维过程中的重置按钮并让思路更加清晰一些。

Finally, it feels very good to put this post up. It’s been way, way too long. The last year has been pretty frustrating for me and anyone who likes Wait But Why—a lot of build-up of ideas with none of the satisfying release of those ideas on the blog (most of my last year has been spent working on another, way longer post). I’m hoping this WBW Dark Ages era is nearing its end, because I miss hanging out here. Thanks, as always, to the small group of ridiculously generous, ridiculously patient patrons who have stuck with us through such a slow period.

最后，把这个帖子发出来感觉非常好。已经过去了很久。去年对我和任何喜欢 Wait But Why这篇文章 的人来说都非常令人沮丧——我积累了很多想法，但没有篇令人满意博客发表（我去年的大部分时间都花在了另一个更长的博文上）。我希望这个 WBW 黑暗时代即将结束，因为我想念在这里闲逛。一如既往地感谢一小群非常慷慨、非常耐心的patron支持者，他们在如此缓慢的时期里一直陪伴着我们。


Your Life Path So Far

到目前为止你的人生道路

For most of us, childhood is kind of like a river, and we’re kind of like tadpoles.

对于我们大多数人来说，童年有点像一条河，我们有点像蝌蚪。

We didn’t choose the river. We just woke up out of nowhere and found ourselves on some path set for us by our parents, by society, and by circumstances. We’re told the rules of the river and the way we should swim and what our goals should be. Our job isn’t to think about our path—it’s to succeed on the path we’ve been placed on, based on the way success has been defined for us.

我们没有选择河流。 我们突然醒来，发现自己走上了父母、社会和环境为我们设定的道路。 我们被告知河流的规则、我们应该游泳的方式以及我们的目标应该是什么。 我们的工作不是思考我们的道路——而是根据为我们定义的成功方式，在我们被安排的道路上取得成功。

For many of us—and I suspect for a large portion of Wait But Why readers—our childhood river then feeds into a pond, called college.

对于我们中的许多人来说——我怀疑对于《等待但为什么》的大部分读者来说——我们童年的河流然后汇入一个叫做大学的池塘。

We may have some say in which particular pond we landed in, but in the end, most college ponds aren’t really that different from one another.

我们可能会说我们降落在哪个特定的池塘，但最后，大多数大学池塘彼此之间并没有那么不同。

In the pond, we have a bit more breathing room and some leeway to branch out into more specific interests. We start to ponder, looking out at the pond’s shores—out there where the real world starts and where we’ll be spending the rest of our lives. This usually brings some mixed feelings.

在池塘里，我们有更多的喘息空间和一些余地，可以扩展到更具体的兴趣。 我们开始思考，看着池塘的岸边——那里是现实世界的起点，也是我们将在哪里度过余生的地方。 这通常会带来一些复杂的感觉。

And then, 22 years after waking up in a rushing river, we’re kicked out of the pond and told by the world to go make something of our lives.

然后，在湍急的河流中醒来 22 年后，我们被踢出池塘，世界告诉我们要去创造我们的生活。

There are a few problems here. One is that at that moment, you’re kind of skill-less and knowledge-less and a lot of other things-less:

这里有几个问题。 一个是在那一刻，你有点缺乏技能和知识，还有很多其他的东西更少：

But before you can even address your general uselessness, there’s an even bigger issue—your pre-set path ended. Kids in school are kind of like employees of a company where someone else is the CEO. But no one is the CEO of your life in the real world, or of your career path—except you. And you’ve spent your whole life becoming a pro student, leaving you with zero experience as the CEO of anything. Up to now, you’ve only been in charge of the micro decisions—”How do I succeed at my job as a student?”—and now you’re suddenly holding the keys to the macro cockpit as well, tasked with answering stressful macro questions like “Who am I?” and “What are the important things in life?” and “What are my options for paths and which one should I choose and how do I even make a path?” When we leave school for the last time, the macro guidance we’ve become so accustomed to is suddenly whisked away from us, leaving us standing there holding our respective dicks, with no idea how to do this.

但在你解决你普遍的无用问题之前，还有一个更大的问题——你的预设路径已经结束。学校里的孩子有点像公司的员工，其他人是首席执行官。但没有人是你在现实世界中生活或职业道路的首席执行官——除了你。而且您一生都在成为一名职业学生，而您作为任何事物的 CEO 的经验为零。到目前为止，你只负责微观决策——“作为一名学生，我如何在工作中取得成功？”——现在你突然也掌握了宏观驾驶舱的钥匙，负责应对压力诸如“我是谁？”之类的宏观问题和“生活中最重要的事情是什么？”和“我的路径有哪些选择，我应该选择哪一条，我什至如何制作路径？”当我们最后一次离开学校时，我们已经习以为常的宏观指导突然从我们身边消失了，让我们站在那里拿着各自的鸡巴，不知道该怎么做

Then time happens. And we end up on a path. And that path becomes our life’s story.

然后时间流逝。我们最终走上了一条道路。这条道路成为我们人生的故事。

At the end of our life, when we look back at how things went, we can see our life’s path in its entirety, from an aerial view.

在我们生命的尽头，当我们回顾事情的经过时，我们可以从空中俯瞰整个人生轨迹。

When scientists study people on their deathbed and how they feel about their lives, they usually find that many of them feel some serious regrets. I think a lot of those regrets stem from the fact that most of us aren’t really taught about path-making in our childhoods, and most of us also don’t get much better at path-making as adults, which leaves many people looking back on a life path that didn’t really make sense, given who they are and the world they lived in.

当科学家们研究临终者以及他们对生活的感受时，他们通常会发现他们中的许多人都感到一些严重的遗憾。 我认为很多遗憾都源于我们大多数人在童年时代并没有真正接受过关于造道的教育，而且我们大多数人在成年后也没有在造道方面做得更好，这让很多人 考虑到他们是谁以及他们所生活的世界，回顾一条没有真正意义的人生道路。

So this is a post about path-making. Let’s take a 30-minute pre-deathbed pause to look down at the path we’re on, and ahead at where that path seems to be going, and make sure it makes sense.

所以这是一篇关于路径制作的帖子。 让我们在临终前暂停 30 分钟，看看我们正在走的路，然后看看这条路似乎要走的地方，并确保它是有意义的。

The Cook and the Chef—Revisited

主厨 vs 厨师——重写

In the past, I’ve written about the critical distinction between “reasoning from first principles” and “reasoning by analogy”—or what I called being a “chef” vs. being a “cook.” Since writing the post, I notice this distinction everywhere, and I’ve thought about it roughly 2 million times in my own life.

过去，我写过“从第一原理推理”和“类比推理”之间的关键区别——或者我所说的“厨师”与“厨师”之间的关键区别。 自从写这篇文章以来，我到处都注意到了这种区别，我在自己的生活中已经思考了大约 200 万次。

reasoning from first principles=从第一原理推理
reasoning by analogy=类比原理

Tim Urban在他的之前的一篇文章中分析了这两种方式的优缺点https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html）。

The idea is that reasoning from first principles is reasoning like a scientist.

从第一法则推理的想法就是像科学家一样推理。

You take core facts and observations and use them to puzzle together a conclusion, kind of like a chef playing around with raw ingredients to try to make them into something good.

你挑选核心证据和观察结果，用它们来拼合出一个结论，有点像厨师尝试食材原材料，尝试把它们做成好吃的菜肴。

By doing this puzzling, a chef eventually writes a new recipe. The other kind of reasoning—reasoning by analogy—happens when you look at the way things are already done and you essentially copy it, with maybe a little personal tweak here and there—kind of like a cook following an already written recipe.

通过解这个谜题，一个厨师最后会写出一个新菜谱。其他类型的推理，类比推理，是你观察其他事情已经被执行的方式，然后你实际上就是复制它的操作，也许或多或少加一点个人的理解，就像一个厨子按照写好的菜谱做菜。

A pure verbatim recipe-copying cook and a pure independently inventive chef are the two extreme ends of what is, of course, a spectrum. But for any particular part of your life that involves reasoning and decision making, wherever you happen to be on the spectrum, your reasoning process can usually be boiled down to fundamentally chef-like or fundamentally cook-like. Creating vs. copying. Originality vs. conformity.

当然，一个只会照本宣科复刻食谱的厨师和一个只独立发明的厨师是两个极端。 但是对于你生活中涉及推理和决策的任何特定部分，无论你碰巧在哪个频段内，你的推理过程通常可以归结为类主厨本质或类厨师本质。 创建比拼复制。 独创性比拼一致性。

Being a chef takes a tremendous amount of time and energy—which makes sense, because you’re not trying to reinvent the wheel, you’re trying to invent it for the first time.

做一个主厨需要巨大的时间与精力，这很合理，因为你不是尝试再次造轮子，而是尝试第一个发明它。

Puzzling your way to a conclusion feels like navigating a mysterious forest while blindfolded and always involves a whole lot of failure, in the form of trial and error.

揭开你自己通往结论的道路，就像蒙着眼睛导航在神秘的森林中，经历考验、偏差，包括一次又一次的失败。

Being a cook is far easier and more straightforward and less icky. In most situations, being a chef is a terrible waste of time, and comes with a high opportunity cost, since time on Earth is immensely scarce.

做一名厨师要容易得多，更直接，也不会那么讨厌。 在大多数情况下，当主厨是一种可怕的时间浪费，并且伴随着高昂的机会成本，因为地球上的时间非常稀缺。

Right now, I’m wearing J. Crew jeans and a plain t-shirt and a hoodie and Allbirds shoes, because I’m trying to conform.
现在，我穿着J. Crew牛仔裤，纯色t恤衫，一件连帽衫和Allbirds懒人鞋，因为我试着去顺应自我。

Throughout my life, I’ve looked around at people who seem kind of like me and I’ve bought a bunch of clothes that look like what they wear. And this makes sense—because clothes aren’t important to me, and they’re not how I choose to express my individuality.

纵观我的生活，我环顾四周，看看那些看起来有点像我的人，我买了一堆看起来像是他们穿的衣服。这有意义——因为衣服对我来说并不重要，它们不是我选择表达我个性的方式。

So in my case, fashion is a perfect part of life to use a reasoning shortcut and be a cook.

所以就我而言，时尚是生活中一个可以完美使用推理捷径的部分，做一名厨子。

But then there are those parts of life that are really really deeply important—like where you choose to live, or the kinds of friends you choose to make, or whether you want to get married and to whom, or whether you want to have kids and how you want to raise them, or how you set your lifestyle priorities.

但是生命中有些部分是尤为重要的，比如你选择在哪里生活，交什么样的朋友，是否想要生育孩子，如何养育孩子，或者你如何设定生活方式的优先级。

Career-path-carving is definitely one of those really really deeply important things. Let’s spell out the obvious reasons why:

Time. For most of us, a career (including ancillary career time, like time spent commuting and thinking about your work) will eat up somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000 hours.

职业道路雕刻绝对是那些非常非常重要的事情之一。 让我们详细说明原因：

时间。 对于我们大多数人来说，一份职业（包括辅助职业时间，比如通勤和思考工作的时间）会消耗 50,000 到 150,000 小时。

At the moment, a long human life runs at about 750,000 hours. When you subtract childhood (~175,000 hours) and the portion of your adult life you’ll spend sleeping, eating, exercising, and otherwise taking care of the human pet you live in, along with errands and general life upkeep (~325,000 hours), you’re left with 250,000 “meaningful adult hours.”

人生总长度75万小时，减掉童年17.5万小时，成年期间睡觉、吃饭、运动、照顾家人宠物的时间，以及一些杂事和生活事务32.5万小时。你还剩下25万有意义的成年时间

So a typical career will take up somewhere between 20% and 60% of your meaningful adult time—not something to be a cook about.

一份典型的职业将会占据你有意义的成年时光的2到6成，这可不是什么适合做厨子的工作。

Quality of Life. 

生活质量

Your career has a major effect on all the non-career hours as well. For those of us not already wealthy through past earnings, marriage, or inheritance, a career doubles as our means of support. The particulars of your career also often play a big role in determining where you live, how flexible your life is, the kinds of things you’re able to do in your free time, and sometimes even in who you end up marrying.

你的职业对所有非职业时间也有重大影响。 对于我们这些尚未因过去的收入、婚姻或遗产而变得富有的人来说，职业是我们的支持手段。 你职业生涯的细节也常常在决定你住在哪里、你的生活有多灵活、你在空闲时间能做的事情种类、有时甚至决定你最终嫁给谁方面发挥着重要作用。

Impact. 

影响

On top of your career being the way you spend much of your time and the means of support for the rest of your time, your career triples as your primary mode of impact-making. Every human life touches thousands of other lives in thousands of different ways, and all of those lives you alter then go on to touch thousands of lives of their own.

除了你的职业生涯是你花费大部分时间的方式和剩余时间的支持方式之外，你的职业生涯是你产生影响的主要方式的三倍。 每个人的生命都以数千种不同的方式触动着数以千计的其他生命，而你所改变的所有这些生命又会继续触动他们自己的数以千计的生命。

We can’t test this, but I’m pretty sure that you can select any 80-year-old alive today, go back in time 80 years, find them as an infant, throw the infant in the trash, and then come back to the present day and find a countless number of things changed. All lives make a large impact on the world and on the future—but the kind of impact you end up making is largely within your control, depending on the values you live by and the places you direct your energy. Whatever shape your career path ends up taking, the world will be altered by it.

我们无法对此进行测试，但我很确定你可以选择任何一个今天还活着的 80 岁老人，回到 80 年前，找到他们还是婴儿，把婴儿扔进垃圾桶，然后再回来 到现在，发现无数的事情发生了变化。 所有的生命都会对世界和未来产生巨大影响——但你最终产生的影响在很大程度上是在你的控制范围内，这取决于你所遵循的价值观和你引导能量的地方。 无论你的职业道路最终采取何种形式，世界都会因此而改变。

Identity. 

身份

In our childhoods, people ask us about our career plans by asking us what we want to be when we grow up. When we grow up, we tell people about our careers by telling them what we are. We don’t say, “I practice law”—we say, “I am a lawyer.” This is probably an unhealthy way to think about careers, but the way many societies are right now, a person’s career quadruples as the person’s primary identity. Which is kind of a big thing.

在我们的童年时代，人们通过问我们长大后想成为什么样的人来询问我们的职业规划。 当我们长大后，我们通过告诉他们我们是什么来告诉他们我们的职业。 我们不会说“我从事法律工作”——我们会说“我是一名律师”。 这可能是一种不健康的职业思考方式，但就像现在许多社会一样，一个人的职业是个人主要身份的四倍。 这是一件大事。

So yeah—your career path isn’t like my shitty sweatshirt. It’s really really deeply important, putting it squarely in “Definitely absolutely make sure to be a chef about it” territory.

所以，是的——你的职业道路不像我的破运动衫。 这真的非常重要，直接把它放在“绝对绝对确保成为一个厨师”的领域。

Your Career Map

你的职业地图

Which brings us to you. I don’t know exactly what your deal is. But there’s a good chance you’re somewhere in one of the blue regions—
—which means your career path is a work in progress.

这把我们带到了你身边。 我不知道你的交易是什么。 但是你很有可能在某个蓝色区域的某个地方——
——这意味着你的职业道路还在进行中。

Whether you’re yet to start your career or well into it, somewhere in the back of your mind (or maybe in the very front of it) is a “Career Plans” map.

无论你刚开始职业还是已经深入其中，内心深处的某一处，或者表层，有一张职业计划地图

We can group map holders into three broad categories—each of which is well-represented in the river, in the pond, standing on the shore, and at every stage of adult life.

我们可以将地图持有者分为三大类——每一类都在河流、池塘、岸边以及成年生活的每个阶段都有很好的表现。

One group of people will look at the map and see a big, stressful question mark.巨大，压力重重的问号。

一组人会看地图，看到一个很大的、压力很大的问号。

These are people who feel indecisive 优柔寡断about their career path. They’ve been told to follow their passion, but they don’t feel especially passionate about anything. They’ve been told to let their strengths guide them, but they’re not sure what they’re best at. They may have felt they had answers in the past, but they’ve changed and they’re no longer sure who they are or where they’re going.

这些人对自己的职业道路犹豫不决。 他们被告知要追随自己的热情，但他们对任何事情都没有特别的热情。 他们被告知要让自己的优势引导他们，但他们不确定自己最擅长什么。 他们过去可能觉得自己有答案，但他们已经改变了，他们不再确定自己是谁或要去哪里。

Other people will see a nice clear arrow representing a direction they feel confident is right—but find their legs walking in a different direction. They’re living with one of the most common sources of human 苦难misery, a career path they know in their heart is wrong.

其他人会看到一个漂亮的清晰箭头，代表他们认为正确的方向 - 但发现他们的腿走在不同的方向。 他们生活在最常见的人类保护痛苦来源之一中，他们心里知道这条职业道路是错误的。

The lucky ones feel they know where they want to go and believe they’re marching in that direction.行进

幸运的一波人感到他们知道他们想去哪，相信他们正朝着这个方向行进

But even these people should pause and ask themselves, “Who actually drew this arrow? Was it really me?” The answer can get confusing.

但是即便时这些人也应该暂停问问自己，“谁画的这个箭头？是我自己么？“这个答案可能令人困惑

I’m pretty sure all of these people would benefit from a moment of career path reflection.

我很确定所有这些人都能从片刻的职业道路反思中获益。

The Okay But Why Do You Think You Can Help Me With My Career Reflection You Draw Stick Figures for a Living Blue Box

“看着还行但为什么你认为你可以帮助我职业反思，你给一个活着的蓝色盒子画木棍数字“

Extremely fair question. One thing I always ask myself as I pick topics to write about is, “Am I qualified to write about this?” Here are the reasons I decided to take on this topic:

很合理的问题。当我选择写作话题的时候，我总是扪心自问：“我有资格写这个吗？“。以下是我决定采用这个话题的原因：

I have spent most of the last 20 years in a perpetual state of analyzing my own career path.

My path has taken a lot of turns—from wanting to be a movie star when I was 7 to wanting to be the president when I was 17 to wanting to write film scores when I was 22 to wanting to be an entrepreneur when I was 24 to wanting to write musicals when I was 29 to most recently wanting to be a writer-ish guy.

After being pretty all over the place about my career path for most of my life, I actually love my job now. That’s always subject to change, but being able to look at the decision-making processes that led me to confusing or frustrating places, side by side with the decisions that led me to a more fulfilling place, has offered me some wisdom on where people tend to go wrong.

On top of having my own story to look at, I’ve had a front-row seat for the stories of my dozen or so closest friends. My friends seem to share my career path obsessiveness, so between observing their paths and talking with them about those paths again and again along the way, I’ve broadened my views on the topic, which helps me to distinguish between the lessons that are my-life specific and those that are more universal.

Finally, this isn’t a post about which careers are better or worse than others or which career values are more or less meaningful—there are lots of social scientists and self-help authors out there with good data on that, and I’m not one of them. It’s instead a framework that I think can help a career-path reflector better see their own situation, and what really matters to them, clearly and honestly. This framework has worked really well for me, so I think it can probably be helpful for other people too.

1 我花费了过去二十年的大部分时间分析自己的职业道路

2 我的人生经历了很多转折，从7岁时想成为电影明星，17岁时想当总统，22岁时想写电影配乐，24岁时想做企业家，29岁时想创作音乐剧，最近想成为一名作家。

3 在职业道路上兜兜转转了大半生以后，我现在真的很热爱我的工作。情况总是会发生变化，但能够看到导致我陷入困惑或令人沮丧的地方的决策过程，和看到一些让我进入一个更令人满意的地方的决策，让我对人们容易出错的地方有了一些人生智慧。

4 除了有我自己的故事要看之外，我还亲身听了十几个最亲密的朋友讲故事。我的朋友似乎分享了与我相同的职业道路执念，一路上我始终在观察他们的道路和与他们聊道路发展，在这个话题上的见识逐渐广博，这帮助了我分辨某些经验教训是我特有的还是普世的。

5 最后一点，这不是一篇讲述某些职业更好或者更差，或者哪些职业价值观更有或者更没意义的文章。有很多社科学家和自助书籍作家在这方面有很好的数据，我不是其中之一。相反，我提供一个框架，可以帮助职业道路反思者更好地了解自己的情况，以及对他们来说真正重要的是什么。这个框架对我来说非常有效，所以我认为它可能对其他人也有帮助。
