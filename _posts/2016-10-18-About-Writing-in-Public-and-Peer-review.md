title: About Writing in Public and Peer review

Although to finish the academic writing is the author’s responsibility, sometimes students and scholars also need some support to keep away from procrastination.

As Moravec shares in Writing in Public, the best solution is meeting peers in person, setting certain time slots and location for writing and discussion. Due to the limitation of time and space, internet provides an alternative. According to the map of AcWriMo 2015[1], group members came from a wide range of universities, countries, and time zones. This may keep this hashtag active all day. Different culture background also provides various points of view about the same topic.

Working in an academic writing group is not just sharing the output, but also about getting pressure from other members. For example, say there is a good runner. If the athlete takes part in a running race and encounters a faster competitor, he is more likely to achieve this certain distance in a shorter time. Doing research is not that competitive as Olympic, but it has the same progress: setting a goal, struggling to become a better ‘oneself’, achieving the goal and sharing it.

The willingness to participate in online writing groups varies from person to person. Moravec has tried a few times, including Feminist Scholar Digital Workshork at HASTAC. This creates an open environment to share the progress of writing, which reduces the loneliness of this long journey.

While doing project, I will write some microblogs to record the current progress. I agree with Charlotte’s key rules in #AcWriMo, setting a clear goal and say it on social media is like setting an alert in public. When I view the websites of phd2published, I love the way they say “Finish your work in November like there is no December”. (This is not the original sentence, but has the same meaning) Last year when I worked on my graduate design project, I kept updating new progress on Weibo(microblog website in China), including bugs, solutions and new features, and uploaded a video of my work at the end.
