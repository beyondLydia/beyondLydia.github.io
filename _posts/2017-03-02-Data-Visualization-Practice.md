First I get some data and codes from examples in http://bl.ocks.org/ and made it run on this site:

Then I tried an open source tool called Palladio operated by standford Humanities + Design lab.

The data is from mobygames.com. I got a list of games published in 2016 for PS4, along with genre, publisher, developer information. It’s not available to share a direct link to this project. But exporting a json file is enough for analysis.

[game-overall-768x327]
game published on PS4 in 2016, title & genre

[game-adventure-768x325]
Adventure game published on PS4 in 2016

Currently I’m working on a group data visualization project, the focus is on Hans Rosling.
